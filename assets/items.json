It was moslty a challenge to see if one, I could implement the features found in the library for modern java. Two, see how complex it would be to implement those features and improve some issues I had with the library at the time.",
                     "  Now part one of this task was a easier that I first believed it would a lot of the libraries features where slight modifications more old versions of modern classes like the Graphics class. Alright, so how to do improve it? That idea led me down a rabbit hole and I ended up creating a library acted sort of like a very basic game engine that handled 2d graphics, some of the video game math, audio and a few more features. I called this SimpleJava. I tried to stick to two core premises when planning the code for the library,If you add a new feature try and make it customizable and keep to the simplistic nature of the old library I was using at school.",
                     "  The problem was that if you wanted to properly use it as intented there was a lot of bugs, the collision detection wasn't that great, the vector math was off, it was slow and overall I knew that I could improve it. So it was abandoned for something faster, more complex, more feature rich. Project Latte."]
